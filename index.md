## CSE 110
Today I worked on Lab 1, where I refreshed my knowledge of working with git commands. These are the steps I took to finish the lab:
1. Installed the specified VS Code extensions
2. Created a new repository and cloned it onto my local machine
3. Created new branches, edited files, and committed the changes
4. Pushed the staged commits to my remote repository
5. Created this User Page with Markdown and published it through GitHub pages

Some commands I used today are `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to push changes from my local repository to my remote repository. Here is a [screenshot]() of the commands I used.

I learned that instead of having to use terminal commands to push these changes, I could use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/downloadLinks%20to%20an%20external%20site.) to both edit files and push changes. This method was a lot more intuitive for me than using the terminal, so I will be using this method more often.

Here is my [Read Me](README.md) file for this lab where I describe my favorite programming language.

Here is my running list of assignments I need to finish for this class.
 - [x] Financial aid survey
 - [x] Slack sign-up
 - [x] Prof greeting
 - [x] In class activity 1
 - [ ] Lab Week 1
